# Face-Recognition-MATLAB
## recognize face parts by user choice
Made by Yarden Yosef && Itai Simhoni

# Introduction
face recognition is a subject that has a use in so many industries and for so many uses, example: police identify, fashion industry or digital image processing
such as photoshop, social media and so on.
recognize face parts by an algorithm could benefit especially in security field.
in this specific project we used GUI which the user can use to choose the part he wishes to recognize in the picture.

## Project Purpose
the main goal of this project is face recognition fully or partly by the user choice interactivly.
this tool could help us identify people, example: when a person is trying to cross a board between countries we will be able to
identify this person by his face. this tool will help us filter the people who enter the country by DataBase and prevent impersonating.

the program will get as an input face picture of single person or multiply persons, and will be able to recognize their faces partly of fully.
in case the part of face that the user chose was found, a message will be displayed that this element was found and in case of multiply parts
was found, the message will change and show the amount of parts found. as it is said above, we are looking for face parts, and if the pic
doesnt include face the message will say so.

our goal is to reach atleast 75% success for this program to detect face parts, this algorithm will work in different lighting conditions and angles.

## Definitions
proper image:
- the camera angle will be above the recognition position, in the center.
- the person/s will face to the camera.
- the face/s wont be hidden fully or partly.
- the pictures has to be clear and close as much as possible to the camera for effective recognition.
- mouth recognition is done at maximum accuracy when the mouth is closed.
- minimum of face/face part is **1**.

not-proper image:
- the camera position is non-strategic.
- the person/s is not facing the camera.
- part of the face/the whole face is hidden.
- non-clear pictures.
- lighting conditions is not good as expected.
- **there is no face/face part in this specific picture.**
